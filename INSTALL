If you are running the ddplot for the first time, copy the supplied
.ddplot file into your home directory and look into it. This file
contains user settings. When ddplot starts, it first checks your
home directory. If it does not find the .ddplot file, it uses the
default settings. You can tune a lot of features of .ddplot by
modifying .ddplot.

INSTALLATION FOR LINUX

Download and install the Qt library version 3.x. The program does not
compile with version 4.x.

In the terminal window, run the following commands:

1. qmake  (generates the Makefile)
2. make   (compiles the program and links it to the shared libs)

Copy the supplied .ddplot file to your home directory and
edit it if you like a different settings. It is always loaded 
when you start ddplot.

Some examples of plot files created by the SBOP code can
be found in the subdirectory plt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION FOR WINDOWS

I. Using the precompiled Qt library from Trolltech:

1. Go to http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp and install the
   precompiled Qt4 library
2. Set the paths as explained in the point 2 below
3. Go to the ddplot directory and run
   qmake
   make
4. Copy the supplied .ddplot file to the root directory of the disc
   where you installed ddplot, e.g. c:\

..........

II. If you want to compile ddplot yourself:

You need to download, unpack and build the Qt library first:

1. Install MinGW with the g++ compiler and make
2. Set the environment variable PATH to point to the bin directory
   where the executables of MinGW are stored. This can be done by 
   right-clicking on My Computer, go to Properties and Advanced tab.
   In the user variables, find the PATH variable and add in something
   like c:\mingw\bin
3. Download the qt-win-free library from the internet and unpack it
4. Open the DOS terminal by invoking the cmd command from the Run
   prompt. 
5. set QTDIR, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other variables described in 
   qt's INSTALL
6. run "configure-mingw" from the terminal. 

At this point the Qt library is built. You can now proceed to compiling
ddplot that can be done in a few steps. In the terminal window, run the
following commands:

1. set QMAKESPEC=win32-g++
2. qmake
3. mingw32-make clean
4. mingw32-make
5. copy qt-mt.dll from %QTDIR%/bin to where your ddplot.exe file is
6. copy the supplied .ddplot file to the root directory of the disc
   where you installed ddplot, e.g. c:\

INSTALLATION FOR MAC OS X

You need to install the Apple Developer's Toolkit from the CD that
came with your Mac OS X. This is called Xcode. Be careful to install
the correct version for your version of the OS X.

Download the Qt4 library for Mac from the internet. ALthough you can
get the binary package, some of them were reported to freeze before
finishing the installation. Therefore, I recommend to get the
qt-mac-opensource-src-VERSION.tar.gz file and compile Qt4 as:

./configure          ... for a dynamic build 
  or 
./configure -static  ... for a static build 
make 
make install

Then, ddplot can be compiled as follows:

qmake
make

Do not forget to copy the supplied .ddplot file to your home directory
(/Users/myname).
