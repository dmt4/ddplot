# Plotting of atomic positions - either "relaxed" or "unrelaxed" configuration
# The displacements in the relaxed configuration are not scaled (real disp.)
# Example:  AtomPos, relaxed, 10
#           AtomPos, unrelaxed
#           AtomPos, composite, 5
AtomPos, unrelaxed

# Factor for scaling the displacements. If the parameter is a value greater than 
# one, the displacements are to be enlarged; if it is smaller than 1, the
# arrows will be shrunk. If you use AUTO, all displacements will be scaled such
# that the largest passes from one atom to another.

# Coordinate system that corresponds to the data in the plot file. 
# The third axis is usually parallel to the Burgers vector, the other two

# Appearance of the atoms in each atomic layer - diameters and thicknesses of 
# the atoms [pixels] and colors. 
# Recognized are 19 names of colors: white, black, red, darkRed, green, 
# darkGreen, blue, darkBlue, cyan, darkCyan, magenta, darkMagenta, yellow, 
# darkYellow, gray, darkGray, lightGray.
# You can enter at least one and maximum 10 input parameters - if you give
# less entries than is the number of atomic layers, the parameters will
# be repeated from the beginning.

# Plot traces of planes - 0 says no, any other number gives the angular step

# The arrows will be plotted between the nearest neighbors and also between
# the third nearest neighbors (ArrNeighbors,1,3)
# For bcc:  ArrNeighbors, 1, 2 otherwise the arrows would be plotted only between

# Cut-off radius for seeking neighboring atoms. This is needed to calculate the RDF
